All notable changes to the BugWatch iOS SDK are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Stack-overflow crashes are now captured.** The signal handlers run on a
  dedicated alternate signal stack (`sigaltstack` + `SA_ONSTACK`). Previously a
  stack overflow left the crashing thread with no stack for the kernel to build
  the signal frame on, so the process died before the handler's first
  instruction and no artifact was written at all. Verified against the real SDK:
  the same overflow produced no artifact before the change and a complete
  62 KB artifact (`signal=11`, 128 frames) after it.

  `sigaltstack` is per-thread and is registered on the thread that calls
  `BugWatch.start(options:)`, so a stack overflow on a background thread is
  still missed.

### Documentation

- Documented what is and is not captured, the automatic breadcrumb catalog,
  device-context fields, the on-disk state layout, the ingest wire format and
  token scheme, a full public API reference, an end-to-end integration
  walkthrough, and the SDK's known limitations.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-24

Initial release.

### Added

- `BugWatch.start(options:)` — SDK initializer; idempotent, installs all handlers
- `BugWatchOptions` — full configuration struct with all fields:
  - `projectId`, `appSecret`, `endpoint`, `environment`, `release`
  - `enabled`, `debug`, `sampleRate`, `sensitiveFields`
  - `autoSessionTracking`, `enableAppHangTracking`, `appHangThresholdMs`
  - `enableAutoBreadcrumbs`, `enableNetworkBreadcrumbs`
  - `networkBreadcrumbAllowedHosts`, `networkBreadcrumbDeniedHosts`
  - `maxQueueSize`, `batchSize`, `flushIntervalMs`, `requestTimeoutMs`, `retry`
- **Native crash capture** — async-signal-safe signal handler (SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/SIGBUS/SIGILL/SIGFPE/SIGTRAP/SIGSYS) + NSException handler; crash artifact processed on next launch into a `.fatal` event with binary-images + instruction-address payload v2 for Symbolicator-based resolution
- **App-hang / ANR detection** — background watchdog detects main-thread stalls ≥ `appHangThresholdMs` and emits a non-fatal `AppHang` event; bypasses sampling
- **Release-health sessions** — Sentry-style `ok`/`exited`/`crashed` session events; bypass sampling; persisted across launches so the prior run's terminal status is always correct
- `BugWatch.capture(error:)` — capture a handled `Error`
- `BugWatch.captureMessage(_:level:)` — capture a plain message at any `Severity` level
- `BugWatch.setUser(_:)` — identify the current user (`BugWatchUser`: id/email/username/ip); pass `nil` on logout
- `BugWatch.setTag(key:value:)` — attach a string tag to all subsequent events
- `BugWatch.setContext(_:value:)` — attach freeform context
- `BugWatch.setRelease(_:)` — update the release identifier post-init (also updates the crash sidecar)
- `BugWatch.addBreadcrumb(_:)` — append a manual breadcrumb; `Breadcrumb`: category/type/level/message/data
- **Auto-breadcrumbs** — app lifecycle transitions (foreground/background/memory warning) via UIApplication notifications; opt-out with `enableAutoBreadcrumbs: false`
- **Network breadcrumbs** — one breadcrumb per outbound `URLSession.shared` HTTP(S) request via global `URLProtocol`; allow/deny-list filtering; BugWatch own ingest always excluded; opt-out with `enableNetworkBreadcrumbs: false`
- `BugWatch.flush()` — async drain; `BugWatch.flush(completion:)` — fire-and-forget variant
- `BugWatch.close()` — full SDK teardown: restores prior crash handlers, uninstalls auto-instrumentation, clears sidecar and session descriptor
- `BugWatch.didCrashOnPreviousExecution` — static Bool readable before `start()`; reflects whether the immediately prior run ended in a native crash
- `BugWatchDiagnosticLog.setHandler(_:)` — install a custom handler for internal `[BugWatch] …` log lines (requires `debug: true`)
- Disk-backed NDJSON event queue with configurable capacity; survives app restarts
- Delivery worker: `batchSize`-chunked NDJSON POSTs to `/api/v1/bugwatch/ingest/mobile` with `x-bugwatch-token` (HMAC-SHA256, 5-min expiry, signed on-device); exponential-backoff retry on 5xx/429/network failures; connectivity-aware (resumes when the network returns)
- Sensitive-field redaction applied before events are written to disk; default list covers common credential/PII field names
- `Severity` enum: `.trace` (10) `.debug` (20) `.info` (30) `.warn` (40) `.error` (50) `.fatal` (60); values match the BugWatch platform wire contract
- `captureWrapperException(type:value:frames:level:platform:rawStacktrace:)` — internal method for React Native and Flutter bridges
- CocoaPods support: `pod 'BugWatch', '~> 0.1'`; uses system `CryptoKit` (no extra deps)
- Swift Package Manager support: `swift-crypto` dependency for HMAC-SHA256
- iOS 14+ and macOS 11+ platform support
